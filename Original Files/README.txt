Toontown Offline - Prologue Update (cv.prologue)

How to run:

1. Extract the contents of the zip file (TTOffPrologue.zip) anywhere on your computer.
2. Once extracted, the server can be started using the "start_server.bat" script.
3. Once the server is ready, you can start the game itself using the "start_game.bat" script.

Having any trouble running the game? First, try installing the needed redistributable package from here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7jVzEZjzgF2UklfOVdDazIxc0k

If the game says "No Districts Available" and the AI server is crashing, try applying the TCP buffer patch: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7jVzEZjzgF2YTlhVmVJR0JFT2M

Download the TCP buffer patch to your computer. Right click and select "Merge" and select "Yes". From here, restart your computer, and you should now be able to start the
AI server without any issues.

Still having trouble? If so, contact JawhnL5 on Reddit, or Sparky Rewritten on YouTube.

Have fun!
